## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the `HARDHAT_CHAIN_ID` environment variable. The port from the example file, if it's free, will be fine in most cases.

Run `npm install`.

### Running The Smart Contract Locally

Compile the ABI for the smart contract using `npx hardhat compile`.

If you're successful, you'll recieve a confirmation message of:

```
Compilation finished successfully
```

And, a `src/artifacts` folder will be created in your project.

Deploy the smart contract to the local blockchain for testing with `npx hardhat node`.

If you're successful, you'll be presented with a number of account details in the CLI. Here's an example:

```
Account #0: 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 (10000 ETH)
Private Key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

Then in a new terminal window, `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost`.

If you're successful, you'll get something like the following CLI output:

```
Greeter deployed to: 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0
```

### Adding A Local Account To MetaMask

Add a new network [learn how here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/78724/metamask-not-showing-localhost-7545)

chainId: 31337

Next, import one of the accounts by adding its Private Key (for example, `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` to MetaMask.

If you're successful, you should see the a balance resembling something like `10000 ETH` in the wallet.

### Connecting The Front-End

In `.env` set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GREETER_ADDRESS` environment variable to the address your smart contract was deployed to. For example, `0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0`.

In a new terminal window, load the front-end with `npm run dev`. If you want to use an alternate port from `3000`, use `npm run dev -- --port=1234`, or whatever port number you prefer.

## Editing The Front-End

To modify the front page of your application, edit `pages/index.js`.

All [TailwindCSS classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) are available to you.

To lint your front-end code, use `npm run lint`.

## Testing

To test your smart contracts, run `npm run test-contracts`.
